									<h3 class="major">Inkblot (Rorschach) Test</h3>
									<p><a href="http://theinkblot.com">You scored 67%.</a></p>
									
									<h4>Sickness Quotient: 67%</h4>
									<p>Hmmm, your "Sickness Quotient" of 67% is a little worriesome.</p>
									
									<h4>Detailed Diagnosis</h4>
									<h4>Interpersonal Insights</h4>
									<p>You complain about everything regardless of what it is. You wouldn't be happy even if you were hit by a new car. You hate your mother and father, your neighbors, co-workers, friends, and just about everyone else who happens to think you're a worthless boob.</p>
								
									<h4>Job Performance and Attitude</h4>
									<p>Your attitude towards work is that you could watch others do it all day long. You work very slowly. In fact, if you went any slower you'd be in reverse. </p>
								
									<h4>Personality Insight</h4>
									<p>Your personal motto is <i>"You are what you do when it counts."</i> And everyone thinks you're an idiot when you say it.</p>
									
									<p>The test results were slightly confronting, albeit a constructive critique of my behavioural patterns. There are a number of positive traits to reinforce, however some necessary negative traits to remain aware of in order to create a team and communicate effectively. Staying up-to-date, communicating with the group and making sure tasks are assigned appropriately to prevent procrastination should be taken into account.</p>
