										<h2 class="major">Interests in IT</h2>
										<p>My main interests related to IT are to do with Space, Agriculture, Weather and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
										<p>Terminator II: Judgement Day is a documentary, not a movie. – After this my interest in IT was eternally sparked.</p>
										<p>In all seriousness a friend of mine in school was incredible with computers, this always garnered my interest subconsciously. Eventually I started a small finance start-up with this friend and other business partners. 3 years later I’m choosing to come to RMIT to solidify my programming knowledge, and hopefully learn how to develop my own ideas, outsourcing development less.</p>
										<p>I expect to have a basic level understanding of how open-source projects are created and collaborated on through services like Github, and create my own projects that can be collaborated on with others.</p>
